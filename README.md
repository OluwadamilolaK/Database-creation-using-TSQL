# Database-creation-using-TSQL
# Database Design using T-SQL
# Overview
This task focused on creating a new database for a client . The tables are in an unnormalized form, so we normalized them to 3NF (Third Normal Form) to prevent insert, delete, and update anomalies as well as redundancies to enhance data integrity and management effectiveness.

**Some of the key functionalities include;******

•	Concurrency was ensured
•	The ability to insert, update and delete data in the database such as the doctor update done earlier (Data Manipulation).
•	Implementing constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints, and other validation rules.
•	Creating and managing tables to store different types of data
•	Views have been created to make easier user interfaces by presenting particular subsets of data or carrying out complex queries. 
•	Stored procedures improve efficiency and security by containing frequently used operations or detailed logic into reusable code units.
•	Attaching data backup and recovery procedures in place to guard against data loss and guarantee system reliability.
•	Enforcing security protocols like encryption, authorization, and authentication is also necessary to protect the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of data.

# Conclusion
The created database has been normalized to 3NF to eliminate any redundant information or anomalies. The database tables are clearly defined, and the table names accurately indicate the types of data they contain. The design is shown above for detail, and the relationships have been established appropriately.
The hospital can improve the integrity, security, and dependability of its database system and guarantee the privacy, accessibility, and accuracy of patient and operational data by complying with the above recommendations and guidelines. The hospital will be able to continue operations even in difficult situations due to proactive backup and recovery procedures that reduce the risk of data loss and system failures.
